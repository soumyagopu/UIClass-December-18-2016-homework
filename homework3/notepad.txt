HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages
HTML elements are represented by tags
HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page
To create a new HTML document, open a new document in Notepad (Notepad should be located under programs/accessories). You will type all your HTML code into this document. To start, type the following HTML code into 
Notepad.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
When you are done typing save your document. When you save an HTML document in Notepad, you must specify that it should be saved as an HTML document. To do this, choose Save As from the file menu. Type in the file name followed by .html. You must also change the Save as Type to All Files or Notepad will automatically save your document as a text document.
Next open an Internet browser (ex. Netscape or Internet Explorer). Choose Open or Open Page from the file menu. Locate and select your HTML document. If you cannot find your HTML document, go back to the previous step and make sure that you saved it properly. Your HTML document should now be displayed in the browser window.
