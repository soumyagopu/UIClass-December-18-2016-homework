Internal Stylesheet	
An internal stylesheet holds the CSS code for the webpage in the head section of the particular file. This makes it easy to apply styles like classes or id's in order to reuse the code. The downside of using an internal stylesheet is that changes to the internal stylesheet only effect the page the code is inserted into.

External Stylesheet	
The External Stylesheet is a .css file that you link your website to. This makes it so that what ever you change in the .css sheet, will effect every page in your website. This prevents you from having to make many code changes in each page. This is for "global" site changes.

Inline Styles	
The Inline style is specific to the tag itself. The inline style uses the HTML "style" attribute to style a specific tag. This is not recommended, as every CSS change has to be made in every tag that has the inline style applied to it. The Inline style is good for one an individual CSS change that you do not use repeatedly through the site.
