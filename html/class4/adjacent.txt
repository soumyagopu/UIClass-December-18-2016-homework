The adjacent sibling selector selects all elements that are the adjacent siblings of a specified element.
Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".
The following example selects all <p> elements that are placed immediately after <div> elements:
Example

div + p {

    background-color: yellow;

}
