Form ... A webform, web form or HTML form on a web page allows a user to enter data that is sent to a server for processing. Forms can resemble paper or database forms because web users fill out the forms using checkboxes, radio buttons, or text fields.

One of the features of HTML5 is the ability to validate most user data without relying on scripts. This is done using validation attributes on form elements.

Our HTML form validation scripts make sure:
You get all the data you want (no fields are left blank)
Data comes to you in the right format (email, URL, address, phone number or anything else)

HTML form validation can be done by JavaScript.

Data validation is the process of ensuring that user input is clean, correct, and useful.

Typical validation tasks are:

has the user filled in all required fields?
has the user entered a valid date?
has the user entered text in a numeric field?
Most often, the purpose of data validation is to ensure correct user input.

Validation can be defined by many different methods, and deployed in many different ways.

Server side validation is performed by a web server, after input has been sent to the server.

Client side validation is performed by a web browser, before input is sent to a web server.

HTML5 introduced a new HTML validation concept called constraint validation.

HTML constraint validation is based on:

Constraint validation CSS Pseudo Selectors
