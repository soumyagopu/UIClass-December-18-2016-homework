Hoisting is the JavaScript interpreter's action of moving all variable and function declarations to the top of the current scope. However, only the actual declarations are hoisted. Any assignments are left where they are.
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.
JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted
In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.
In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.
Example 1
x = 5; // Assign 5 to x

elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element 
elem.innerHTML = x;                     // Display x in the element

var x; // Declare x
