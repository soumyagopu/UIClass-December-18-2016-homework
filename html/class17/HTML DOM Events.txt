HTML DOM Events

HTML DOM events allow JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document.
Events are normally used in combination with functions, and the function will not be executed before the event occurs (such as when a user clicks a button).
Tip: The event model was standardized by the W3C in DOM Level 2.
