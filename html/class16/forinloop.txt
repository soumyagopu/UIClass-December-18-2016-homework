The for/in statement loops through the properties of an object. The block of code inside the loop will be executed once for each property.JavaScript supports different kinds of loops: ... do/while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop while a specified condition is true
Example
Loop through the properties of an object:
var person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25}; 

var text = "";
var x;
for (x in person) {
    text += person[x];
}
The result of text will be:
John Doe 25
