The Object.defineProperties() method defines new or modifies existing properties directly on an object, returning the object.
Syntax
Object.defineProperties(obj, props)
Parameters
obj
The object on which to define or modify properties.
props
An object whose own enumerable properties constitute descriptors for the properties to be defined or modified. Property descriptors present in objects come in two main flavors: data descriptors and accessor descriptors (see Object.defineProperty() for more details). Descriptors have the following keys:
configurable
true if and only if the type of this property descriptor may be changed and if the property may be deleted from the corresponding object.
Defaults to false.
enumerable
true if and only if this property shows up during enumeration of the properties on the corresponding object.
Defaults to false.
value
The value associated with the property. Can be any valid JavaScript value (number, object, function, etc).
Defaults to undefined.
writable
true if and only if the value associated with the property may be changed with an assignment operator.
Defaults to false.
get
A function which serves as a getter for the property, or undefined if there is no getter. The function return will be used as the value of property.
Defaults to undefined.
set
A function which serves as a setter for the property, or undefined if there is no setter. The function will receive as only argument the new value being assigned to the property.
Defaults to undefined.
Return value
The object that was passed to the function.
Description
Object.defineProperties, in essence, defines all properties corresponding to the enumerable own properties of props on the object obj object.
