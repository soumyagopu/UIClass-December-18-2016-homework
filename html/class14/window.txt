Window Object
The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window.
All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
Global variables are properties of the window object.
Global functions are methods of the window object.
Even the document object (of the HTML DOM) is a property of the window object:
window.document.getElementById("header");
is the same as:
document.getElementById("header");
The window object represents an open window in a browser.
If a document contain frames (<iframe> tags), the browser creates one window object for the HTML document, and one additional window object for each frame.
Note: There is no public standard that applies to the Window object, but all major browsers support it.
