The <head> element is a container for all the head elements.
The <head> element can include a title for the document, scripts, styles, meta information, and more.
The following elements can go inside the <head> element:
<title> (this element is required in an HTML document)
<style>
<base>
<link>
<meta>
<script>
<noscript>

The <body> tag defines the document's body.
The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc.

An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and end tag, with the content inserted in between:
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
