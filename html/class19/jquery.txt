jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library created by John Resig in 2006 with a nice motto − Write less, do more.
jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.
jQuery is a JavaScript toolkit designed to simplify various tasks by writing less code. Here is the list of important core features supported by jQuery −
