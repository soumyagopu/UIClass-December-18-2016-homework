This is a library of monochromatic icons available in raster image formats, vector image formats, and as fonts. It provides over 250 glyphs in font format. You can use these fonts in your web projects. These glyphs are not free, however if you don't have to spend anything in case you are using them in Bootstrap based projects.
Loading the Font (library)

Using the Icon
Bootstrap Glyphicons provides a number of icons. Choose one of them and add the name of the icon class to any HTML element within the < body > tag. In the following example, we have used the icon of the tree and its class name is tree-deciduous.

   </body>
</html>
Defining the Size
You can increase or decrease the size of an icon by defining its size in the CSS and using it along with the class name as shown below. In the following example, we have defined the size as 6 em.

      <i class = "glyphicon glyphicon-tree-deciduous mysize"></i>
   </body>
