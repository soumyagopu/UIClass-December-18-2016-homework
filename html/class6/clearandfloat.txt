The float property specifies whether or not an element should float.
The clear property is used to control the behavior of floating elements.
The float Property
In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.
The following example specifies that an image should float to the right in a text:
Example
img {
    float: right;
    margin: 0 0 10px 10px;
}

The clear Property

The clear property is used to control the behavior of floating elements.
Elements after a floating element will flow around it. To avoid this, use the clear property.
The clear property specifies on which sides of an element floating elements are not allowed to float:
Example
div {
    clear: left;
}
