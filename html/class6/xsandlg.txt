The Bootstrap grid system has four classes:
•	xs (for phones)
•	sm (for tablets)
•	md (for desktops)
•	lg (for larger desktops)
The classes above can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.
Each class scales up, so if you wish to set the same widths for xs and sm, you only need to specify xs. 
Bootstrap Grid Example: Mixed: Mobile, Tablet And Desktop
Example
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-7 col-sm-6 col-lg-8">.col-xs-7 .col-sm-6 .col-lg-8</div>
  <div class="col-xs-5 col-sm-6 col-lg-4">.col-xs-5 .col-sm-6 .col-lg-4</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-8 col-lg-10">.col-xs-6 .col-sm-8 .col-lg-10</div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4 col-lg-2">.col-xs-6 .col-sm-4 .col-lg-2</div>
</div>
Bootstrap Grid Example: Small Devices
Assume we have a simple layout with two columns. We want the columns to be split 25%/75% for small devices.
Tip: Small devices are defined as having a screen width from 768 pixels to 991 pixels.
For small devices we will use the .col-sm-* classes.
We will add the following classes to our two columns:
<div class="col-sm-3">....</div>
<div class="col-sm-9">....</div>
Now Bootstrap is going to say "at the small size, look for classes with -sm- in them and use those".
The following example will result in a 25%/75% split on small (and medium and large) devices. On extra small devices, it will automatically stack (100%):
col-sm-3
col-sm-9
Example
<div class="container-fluid">
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:yellow;">
      <p>Lorem ipsum...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-9" style="background-color:pink;">
      <p>Sed ut perspiciatis...</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
Bootstrap Grid Example: Medium Devices
In the previous chapter, we presented a grid example with classes for small devices. We used two divs (columns) and we gave them a 25%/75% split:
<div class="col-sm-3">....</div>
<div class="col-sm-9">....</div>
But on medium devices the design may be better as a 50%/50% split.
Tip: Medium devices are defined as having a screen width from 992 pixels to 1199 pixels.
For medium devices we will use the .col-md-* classes.
Now we will add the column widths for medium devices:
<div class="col-sm-3 col-md-6">....</div>
<div class="col-sm-9 col-md-6">....</div>
Now Bootstrap is going to say "at the small size, look at classes with -sm- in them and use those. At the medium size, look at classes with -md- in them and use those".
The following example will result in a 25%/75% split on small devices and a 50%/50% split on medium (and large) devices. On extra small devices, it will automatically stack (100%):
Example
<div class="container-fluid">
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-3 col-md-6" style="background-color:yellow;">
      <p>Lorem ipsum...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-9 col-md-6" style="background-color:pink;">
      <p>Sed ut perspiciatis...</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
Bootstrap Grid Example: Large Devices
In the previous chapter, we presented a grid example with classes for small and medium devices. We used two divs (columns) and we gave them a 25%/75% split on small devices, and a 50%/50% split on medium devices:
<div class="col-sm-3 col-md-6">....</div>
<div class="col-sm-9 col-md-6">....</div>
But on large devices the design may be better as a 33%/66% split.
Tip: Large devices are defined as having a screen width from 1200 pixels and above.
For large devices we will use the .col-lg-* classes.
So now we will add the column widths for large devices:
<div class="col-sm-3 col-md-6 col-lg-4">....</div>
<div class="col-sm-9 col-md-6 col-lg-8">....</div>
Now Bootstrap is going to say "at the small size, look at classes with -sm- in them and use those. At the medium size, look at classes with -md- in them and use those. At the large size, look at classes with the word -lg- in them and use those".
The following example will result in a 25%/75% split on small devices, a 50%/50% split on medium devices, and a 33%/66% split on large devices:
Example
<div class="container-fluid">
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-3 col-md-6 col-lg-4" style="background-color:yellow;">
      <p>Lorem ipsum...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-9 col-md-6 col-lg-8" style="background-color:pink;">
      <p>Sed ut perspiciatis...</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
