Grid System Rules
Some Bootstrap grid system rules:
•	Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment and padding
•	Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns
•	Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows
•	Predefined classes like .row and .col-sm-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts
•	Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column via negative margin on .rows
•	Grid columns are created by specifying the number of 12 available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three .col-sm-4

Basic Structure of a Bootstrap Grid
The following is a basic structure of a Bootstrap grid:
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-*-*"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-*-*"></div>
    <div class="col-*-*"></div>
    <div class="col-*-*"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    ...
  </div>
</div>
So, to create the layout you want, create a container (<div class="container">). Next, create a row (<div class="row">). Then, add the desired number of columns (tags with appropriate .col-*-* classes). Note that numbers in .col-*-* should always add up to 12 for each row.
