update a property value in object


 $.extend(true, skillet.person, {
  name: {
    first: 'updated'
  },
  birthday: {
    day: 'updated',
    year: 'updated'
  }
});

push is a method of Arrays that adds a new item to an array.
If you want to replace the value then:
skillet.person.name = { â€¦ };
If you want to store multiple (full) names in the object, then you'll need the property to hold an array of objects instead of a single object.
