In JavaScript, I've created an object like so:

var data = {
    'PropertyA': 1,
    'PropertyB': 2,
    'PropertyC': 3
};
Is it possible to add further properties to this object after it's initial creation if the properties name is not determined until run time? i.e.
var propName = 'Property' + someUserInput
//imagine someUserInput was 'Z', how can I now add a 'PropertyZ' property to 
//my object?

 Adding New Properties
You can add new properties to an existing object by simply giving it a value.
Assume that the person object already exists - you can then give it new properties:
Example
person.nationality = "English";
