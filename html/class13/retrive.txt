JavaScript for...in Loop
The JavaScript for...in statement loops through the properties of an object.
Syntax
for (variable in object) {
    code to be executed
}
The block of code inside of the for...in loop will be executed once for each property.
Looping through the properties of an object:
Example
var person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25}; 

for (x in person) {
    txt += person[x];
}

You can get a property by name using the Select-Object cmdlet and specifying the property name(s) that you're interested in. Note that this doesn't simply return the raw value for that property; instead you get something that still behaves like an object.
[PS]> $property = (Get-Process)[0] | Select-Object -Property Name

[PS]> $property

Name
----
armsvc

[PS]> $property.GetType().FullName
System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject
In order to use the value for that property, you will still need to identify which property you are after, even if there is only one property:
[PS]> $property.Name
armsvc

[PS]> $property -eq "armsvc"
False

[PS]> $property.Name -eq "armsvc"
True

[PS]> $property.Name.GetType().FullName
System.String
