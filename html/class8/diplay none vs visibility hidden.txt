The display property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout.

The display Property
The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.
Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.
Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
The <div> element is a block-level element.
Examples of block-level elements:
•	<div>
•	<h1> - <h6>
•	<p>
•	<form>
•	<header>
•	<footer>
•	<section>

Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
This is an inline <span> element inside a paragraph.
Examples of inline elements:
•	<span>
•	<a>
•	<img>

Display: none;
display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them. Take a look at our last example on this page if you want to know how this can be achieved.
The <script> element uses display: none; as default. 

Override The Default Display Value
As mentioned, every element has a default display value. However, you can override this.
Changing an inline element to a block element, or vice versa, can be useful for making the page look a specific way, and still follow the web standards.
A common example is making inline <li> elements for horizontal menus:
Example
li {
    display: inline;
}
The following example displays <span> elements as block elements:
Example
span {
    display: block;
}
Hiding an element can be done by setting the display property to none. The element will be hidden, and the page will be displayed as if the element is not there:
Example
h1.hidden {
    display: none;
}
visibility:hidden; also hides an element.
However, the element will still take up the same space as before. The element will be hidden, but still affect the layout:
Example
h1.hidden {
    visibility: hidden;
}
Difference between display:none and visiblity: hidden
visibility:hidden hides the element, but it still takes up space in the layout.
display:none removes the element from the document. It does not take up any space.
