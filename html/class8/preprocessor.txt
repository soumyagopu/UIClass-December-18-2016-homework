A preprocessor is a program that takes one type of data and converts it to another type of data. In the case of HTML and CSS, some of the more popular preprocessor languages include Haml and Sass. Haml is processed into HTML and Sass is processed into CSS.
Upon setting out to solve some of the more common problems, Haml and Sass found many additional ways to empower HTML and CSS, not only by removing the inefficiencies but also in creating ways to make building websites easier and more logical. The popularity of preprocessors have also brought along different frameworks to support them, one of the more popular being Compass.
