The box-sizing property is used to tell the browser what the sizing properties (width and height) should include.
Should they include the border-box? Or just the content-box (which is the default value of the width and height properties)?
Default value:	content-box
Inherited:	no
Animatable:	no. Read about animatable

Version:	CSS3
JavaScript syntax:	object.style.boxSizing="border-box"Try it

Specify that <div> elements should have padding and border included in the element's total width and height:
div {
    width: 300px;
    height: 100px;
    border: 1px solid blue;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
CSS Syntax
box-sizing: content-box|border-box|initial|inherit;
Property Values
Value	Description
content-box	Default. The width and height properties (and min/max properties) includes only the content. Border, padding, or margin are not included
border-box	The width and height properties (and min/max properties) includes content, padding and border, but not the margin
initial	Sets this property to its default value. Read about initial

inherit	Inherits this property from its parent element. Read about inherit


With the CSS3 box-sizing Property
The CSS3 box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.
Here is the same example as above, with box-sizing: border-box; added to both <div> elements:
Example
.div1 {
    width: 300px;
    height: 100px;
    border: 1px solid blue;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

.div2 {
    width: 300px;
    height: 100px;
    padding: 50px;
    border: 1px solid red;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
Since the result of using the box-sizing: border-box; is so much better, many developers want all elements on their pages to work this way.
The code below ensures that all elements are sized in this more intuitive way. Many browsers already use box-sizing: border-box; for many form elements (but not all - which is why inputs and text areas look different at width: 100%;).
Applying this to all elements is safe and wise:
Example
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
